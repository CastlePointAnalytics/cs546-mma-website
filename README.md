# CS 546 Final Project Group 18

## Team Members
- Elias Frieling
- Tayler Marin
- Luke McEvoy
- Ryan Perretta
- Eleonora Savova

## Introduction

- We are developing an MMA website that provides analytics on fighter combinations, expected values of betting strategy portfolios, and forums for fighter match up debates. 
- The fighter statistics will be static, but the combinations, conversation, and portfolio possibilities are limitless.

## Motivation

- The MMA market lacks data driven discussion regarding fighter matchups. Furthermore, there is no medium to quantify a portfolio spread through different betting strategies.
- We are looking to fill that void with our project

3. Match Up Statistic Page
